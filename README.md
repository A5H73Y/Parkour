# Parkour
Development builds for the Bukkit Parkour plugin (v4.0)

Things not done:
- Some Listeners
- Most signs
- An end-to-end

Things done:
- Most commands
- The actual framework (joining / leaving / creating course etc.)
- Some Listeners
- Some Signs
- Started on the 'Parkour levels' side of things

# Please note: Most code has not been tested in game, so I'm unsure if it will work as expected.
* Just checked, checkpoints are not working, will look at this soon.
* I'd go as far to say to hold off using these builds until I'm happy it's more stable.
