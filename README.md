# Parkour
Development builds for the Bukkit Parkour plugin (v4.0)

Things not done:
- Some Listeners
- Most signs
- An end-to-end

Things done:
- Most commands
- The actual framework (joining / leaving / creating course etc.)
- Some Listeners
- Some Signs

# Please note: Most code has not been tested in game, so I'm unsure if it will work as expected.
