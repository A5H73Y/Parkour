# Parkour

Parkour is the original, most powerful Parkour based plugin available! First released in November 2012 and has been updated since. Parkour 4.0 is now open source, allowing you to contribute ideas and enhancements or make your own spin on the plugin. <p />
Add a whole new element of fun to any server, highly competitive gameplay with rewards and leaderboards.

## Installation
* Install [CraftBukkit](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server) or [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/buildtools-updates-information.42865/).
* Download Parkour from [BukkitDev](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/parkour/files) or [My development website](http://www.mcparkour.co.uk/).
* Place the Parkour.jar into the 'plugins' folder of the server.
* Start your server and check the server logs to ensure the plugin started successfully.

## Tips
* Check that your server version matches the officially supported versions of the plugin.
* Don't use tabs in the configuration files (Bukkit doesn't like it.)
* Check the config.yml and configure it to your preference before fully implementing the plugin.

## Supported plugins
| Plugin        | Description  |
