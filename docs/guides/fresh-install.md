Fresh Installation
======

## Installing the plugin

Setting up the Parkour plugin is super easy, drag and drop the `Parkour-v6.X.jar` into your server's plugin folder and (re)start your server.

Parkour will create all its necessary files upon start up, and then it's ready to go.

## Preparing your server

You are recommended to create a world dedicated for Parkour Courses, although Parkour does have multi-world support. Once you have your world chosen, you should create an area where the Players can choose which Courses to join; This area is called a 'lobby'. Stand where you want the lobby to be saved and enter the command `/pa setlobby`. This only needs to be done once!

When you want to teleport to the Parkour lobby, enter `/pa lobby`. By default, this is where Players are teleported to when they complete or leave a Course. We can create many lobbies which have different locations and requirements, which will be covered later in the tutorials.

You should now have the latest version of Parkour installed, and have a Parkour lobby created.

## Making configuration changes

Parkour is incredibly customisable, using the `config.yml` to set the plugin up perfectly for any server. Changes can be made freely and applied using `/pa reload` but note that some changes require a full server restart to take effect.
