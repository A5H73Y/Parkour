## About Parkour

Parkour allows you to create unlimited Courses, each with unlimited checkpoints, while tracking player times and the amount of deaths. Parkour can easily integrate with any server, allowing for a fully customised setup.

Whether you are setting the plugin up as a mini-game, or as a dedicated Parkour server, the powerful configuration will allow you to choose exactly how you want the plugin to work. A 'ParkourKit' is a set of customisable Materials which will add a whole new level of fun to each Course.

Parkour uses a database to store all the leaderboards for each Course, allowing for powerful and customisable results. By default, the plugin will create a SQLite database locally in the `plugins` folder, in a folder named `sqlite-db`, however if you wish to use a MySQL server of your choice, this can be configured in the `config.yml`.
