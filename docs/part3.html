                        <h2 id="createAutoStart">Creating an AutoStart</h2>
                        <p>It is super easy to create an AutoStart pressure plate that will trigger the joining of a course, instead of using the traditional Join signs.</p>
                        <p>Stand where you would like the AutoStart location to be, and enter <strong>/pa setautostart (course)</strong> which will create a configurable block below you, and a pressure plate on top.</p>

                        <h2 id="createJoinItem">Creating a Join Item</h2>
                        <p>When a player joins a course you are able to give them an item which they can use throughout the course. An example could be an Elytra to help navigate the course, instead of relying on a chest / another plugin.</p>
                        <p>This is achieved by entering <strong>/pa setjoinitem (course) (material) (amount)</strong> an example could be <strong>/pa setjoinitem tutorial ELYTRA 64</strong>.</p>

                        <h2 id="maxDeaths">Set Maximum Deaths</h2>
                        <p>You are able to limit the amount of deaths a player can accumilate before they are kicked off the course for extra challenge. An example could be a quick challenging course that allows the player just 1 life to complete.</p>
                        <p>This is achieved by entering <strong>/pa setmaxdeath (course) (amount)</strong>.</p>

                        <h2 id="maxTime">Set Maximum Time</h2>

                        <h2 id="customLobby">Creating a custom lobby</h2>
                        <p>Parkour can allow courses to be split into different lobbys, which could be used to add stages to the server, for example easy, medium and hard courses. This is made easy by entering <strong>/pa setlobby (name)</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Once submitted, the lobby will be joinable by all players.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AGl0p1A.jpg" alt="Custom Lobby">
                        <p>If you wish to create a lobby that is restricted to only certain players, this can be achieved using Parkour Levels, which we will cover in the Administration tutorials. This will enforce the player to reach a certain level in the courses to be able to join the lobby, for example completing all the courses in the easy lobby to be able to join the hard lobby. This is achieved by providing a minimum Parkour level required to join.</p>
                        <p>This is done by providing a level parameter to the command <strong>/pa setlobby (name) (level)</strong>.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2LP8TK9.jpg" alt="Example Custom Command">
                        <p>Once submitted, the lobby will be joinable by players with the required Parkour level.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/py34xti.jpg" alt="Example Custom Lobby">
                        <p>To teleport to the lobby, simply enter <strong>/pa lobby (name)</strong>.</p>

                        <h2 id="linkCourse">Linking a Course after completion</h2>
                        <p>We can change what happens to a player after they complete a course; They can either be teleported to the default lobby, a custom lobby, or join straight into a new course. Firstly, we must select a course to decide the outcome, this is achieved by entering <strong>/pa select (course)</strong>.</p>
                        <p>After we have created a custom lobby, we can link this course to teleport us to this lobby once we complete the course, this is achieved with the following command <strong>/pa link lobby (lobby name)</strong>.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gc7UVkX.jpg" alt="Linked Lobby">
                        <p>If we want to link a course to another course, the command becomes <strong>/pa link course (course name)</strong>.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1YvM8zV.jpg" alt="Linked Course">
                        <p>If you want to remove the link, simply enter <strong>/pa link reset</strong> which will result in the player being teleported to the default lobby.</p>
