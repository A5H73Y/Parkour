##### Parkour Welcome Message

To disable the Parkour Join message, set `Other.Display.JoinWelcomeMessage` to `false` in the `config.yml`.

To allow for multiple Players to stand on a pressure plate at once, in the `config.yml` find `OnCourse.PreventPlateStick` and set it to `true`.  
_Note that this will prevent normal pressure plates from working while on a Course._
