                        <div id="contents-placeholder"></div>

                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>A course can have a ParkourMode assigned to it, these allow the courses to behave differently and add a new dynamic. Below I will list each mode and what difference they make once applied.</p>
                        <p class="no-margin">To set a ParkourMode to a course, you start the conversation by entering <strong>/pa setmode (course)</strong>, which will talk you through the setup process of each option.</p>
                        <p class="italic">If you want to remove a ParkourMode, you can set the mode back to "None".</p>

                        <h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
                        <p>This mode allows you to set and load your own checkpoints anywhere throughout the course, using the freedom tool. Which will be added to your inventory when you join:</p>

                        <p>When you join a Freedom course, it will display a message to explain how the tool works:</p>

                        <p>And it's as simple as that, right click with the tool to save your position, and left click to load it.</p>

                        <h2 id="darkness">Darkness</h2>
                        <p>Straight forward, this applies Blindness II to the player throughout the course. If the player leaves the effect is removed. This will make it harder for the player to anticipate where to go and makes the course far more challenging.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2yDVqoG.png" alt="Darkness Usage" class="img-thumbnail"/>

                        <h2 id="drunk">Drunk</h2>
                        <p>Straight forward, this applies Nausea II to the player throughout the course. If the player leaves the effect is removed. This disorientates the player and makes the course far more challenging.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MBrlABX.png" alt="Drunk Usage" class="img-thumbnail"/>

                        <h2 id="speedy">Speedy</h2>
                        <p>Simply sets the players movement speed to what is set in the config.yml. Allows you to run faster and jump further. Movement speed is reset to default once the player leaves.</p>

                        <h2 id="moon">Moon</h2>
                        <p>Straight forward, this applies Jump Boost to the player throughout the course. If the player leaves the effect is removed. This will allow the player to reach new heights and simulate low gravity.</p>

                        <h2 id="dropper">Dropper</h2>
                        <p>This allows you to integrate the plugin into the 'dropper' gamemode, allowing you to fall infinitely without dying or taking any fall damage. You can use DeathBlocks to allow the player to die if they hit a block.</p>

                        <h2 id="rockets">Rockets</h2>
                        <p>Inspired by CodJumping, when you use an RPG's explosion to propel yourself into the air to gain additional height and velocity.</p>
                        <p>You will be given a 'Rocket Launcher', which is a Rocket by default. Simply right click with the item in your hand and you will have a knockback applied to your player, which you can use to reach new heights and distances. Can only be used once every second, to reduce risk of it being abused.</p>
