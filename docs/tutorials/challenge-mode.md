## What is a Challenge Mode?

You are able to challenge other Players to a Course to prove who is the best. To make things more interesting, you can place a wager to give to the winner.

You are able to create a Challenge manually using a command and invite only players who you want, or you can interact with a Challenge sign to join other Players interested in a Challenge.
