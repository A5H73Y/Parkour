AutoStarts
======

An AutoStart allows you walk on a pressure plate that will automatically start the specified Course.

## Creating an AutoStart

An AutoStart pressure plate will trigger an automatic joining of a Course, instead of using the traditional Join signs or command.

_Command: `/pa setautostart (course)`_  
Stand where you would like the AutoStart location to be, and the configured Material will be placed below you with a pressure plate on top.

### Delete an AutoStart

Deleting an AutoStart is simple, with the correct permission you are able to break the pressure plate which will delete the AutoStart.
