Players

As of Parkour 7.0.0 each player has their own configuration file, which contains their progress and data.

## Player Information

To display a summary of everything Parkour knows about a player enter `/pa info (player)`.

This will include any information stored, as well as any details on the Course they are currently on.

_Command: `/pa reset player (player)`_
