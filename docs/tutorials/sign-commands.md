## Effects Signs

You can apply several effects to the player on the Course. These are activated by right clicking the signs whilst on a course.

The effects are derived from PotionEffectType available from the server.

There are 2 hardcoded effects, these include:

    Heal
        Fully restore the player's health.
    Gamemode
        Requires a GameMode on the bottom line to apply the GameMode specified.

For the other effects, you simply put the name of the PotionEffectType on the second line. For example `JUMP`, then on the bottom line you will put the duration and strength in the format of `duration:strength` for example `1000:6`

For resistance effects that may not fit on the line such as `DAMAGE_RESISTANCE` this can be shortened to `DAMAGE_RESIST`.

## Course Checkpoint

You can have a manual checkpoint sign, instead of walking on a pressure-plate. The number must equal the next checkpoint you need to achieve to apply the checkpoint.

These work the same way as previous "SetPoint" signs, they simply load the checkpoint, and do not create one. The checkpoint must be created via `/pa checkpoint` and then the pressure plate can be replaced by the checkpoint sign to activate the loading of the checkpoint.
