Parkour 6.0
======

This update is a rewrite of v5.3 with performance and usability being at the forefront of every decision.

**If you have 5.3 installed, Parkour 6.0 will automatically upgrade your configuration.**

* Simply stop the server, delete the `Parkour.jar` and replace with `Parkour-6.0.jar`. 
* Start the server and check the console logs, the upgrade process will display the progress made and may take several minutes depending on the scale of your existing config. 
* Once completed you will be prompted to restart the server.

## Main Changes

- Player data is now stored under their UUID, not player name.
- `/pa finish` has been renamed to `/pa ready`

## Technical Information
- The main performance improvement in Parkour 6.0 is caching, almost every entity is stored in memory instead of read from the config files each time. Courses and their associated data is cached when needed, including the top leaderboard times for each course is cached.
- The `Info` utility classes now offer more consistent results
