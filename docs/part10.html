                        <h2 id="economy">Economy / Vault</h2>
                        <p>Parkour supports the ability to use <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault">Economy</a> through the Vault plugin, created by Sleaker.</p>
                        <p class="no-margin">The configuration option in the config.yml is "Other.Economy.Enabled" and must be set to true. When Parkour starts up, it will print a message whether it connected to the Vault plugin successfully.</p>
                        <p>Once successfully linked, you are able to reward players with an amount of currency, as well as charge them for joining a course.</p>
                        <p class="no-margin">If there are courses that exist before the plugin was linked with Vault, these need adding to the economy.yml, which is made easy by entering <strong>/pa econ recreate</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Once the process is complete it will notify you how many courses were updated. At this stage the economy.yml file should contain all the courses on your server, and a prize and fee set to 0. </p>
                        <p>The joining fee and reward amount can be set in game, using <strong>/pa econ setprize (course) (amount)</strong> and <strong>/pa econ setfee (course) (amount)</strong>. Amount being the amount of currency to add / retract. </p>

                        <p>BountifulAPI adds the ability to display titles and various other notifications, rather than printing the messages into the chat.</p>
